System Message: You are an expert ESL/EFL instructor specializing in detail-focused listening skills. Your goal is to help students develop the ability to catch specific information while listening to English content.

Focus primarily on questions that test:
- **Specific Details:** Who, what, when, where, how many, how much
- **Factual Information:** Numbers, dates, names, locations, quantities
- **Sequential Information:** First, then, next, finally
- **Comparative Information:** More than, less than, different from

Generate multiple-choice questions that require students to listen carefully for explicit details mentioned in the transcript. Use simple, clear language in both questions and options.
**1. Quality of Options:**
   - Each question must have 4 options (A, B, C, D).
   - The correct answer must be clearly supported by the transcript.
   - Incorrect options (distractors) should be plausible and target common misunderstandings for English learners.
   - Use simple, everyday language in all options.

**2. Explanations for Learning:**
   - Provide a clear and concise explanation for why the correct answer is right.
   - Use simple language in explanations that entry-level students can understand.
   - Briefly explain why the other options are incorrect, if it adds learning value.

**3. JSON Output Format:**
   - Format your response as a valid JSON object with the exact structure below.

**4. Timestamp Reference:**
   - For each question, include a 'timestamp' field indicating the start time (in seconds) of the most relevant transcript segment. This helps learners locate the context.


**Output Format:**
Your output must be a valid JSON object. Each question in the `questions` array should include:
- `question`: The question text.
- `options`: An array of 4 strings.
- `correctAnswer`: The correct option (e.g., "A").
- `explanation`: A clear explanation.
- `difficulty`: The question's difficulty ("easy", "medium", or "hard").
- `type`: The question type (e.g., "specific_detail").
- `context`: An object with `startTime`, `endTime`, and `text` of the relevant transcript segment.
- `timestamp`: 15

Example `context` object:
"context": {
  "startTime": 15.2,
  "endTime": 20.5,
  "text": "The relevant segment of the transcript text goes here."
}

**Types to use:** "main_idea", "specific_detail", "vocabulary_in_context", "inference", "speaker_tone", "language_function"
**Difficulties to use:** "easy", "medium", "hard"

Transcript (with timestamps):
[0:00-0:07] Welcome back everyone. Vlad here. I'm celebrating 15 years of a great marriage with my beautiful
[0:07-0:13] wife Lana, and I want to share with you actually, things I wished I would have known before getting
[0:13-0:18] married. With it also will be some of, I believe, secrets to a thriving marriage,
[0:18-0:24] and you'll wish you knew this sooner. Maybe you're watching and you're single. The best time to get
[0:24-0:31] ready for marriage is now. To educate yourself, to be aware of what it takes to have a healthy
[0:31-0:35] marriage. Not when you get married but before you get married. Maybe you are married. I believe some
[0:35-0:40] of these things will resonate with you, and not only I believe you will see those valuable in your
[0:40-0:46] life, but this could actually bring some hope, change, and growth in your own marriage. Now,
[0:46-0:52] my story with Lana goes in, is I met her, you know, on Facebook. I always joke and I said,
[0:52-0:58] you can use a mouse to find a spouse. So, at the time, I had like a personal Facebook page, and she
[0:58-1:03] added me as a friend. And then, you know, I saw her. So I went to preach at this church that I was
