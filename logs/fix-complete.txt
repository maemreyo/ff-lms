✅ **SEQUENTIAL GENERATION FIX COMPLETE**

🔧 **Root Cause Identified:**
The frontend useGenerateAllQuestions() hook was making 3 separate API calls with specific difficulty parameters, which triggered the single-difficulty path instead of the sequential generation with deduplication.

🛠️ **Fix Applied:**
- Modified /src/hooks/useQuestionGeneration.ts
- Changed from 3 separate API calls to 1 unified call
- Now sends preset object instead of individual difficulty parameters
- This triggers the sequential generation with deduplication path in the API

📊 **Expected Behavior Now:**
- Single API call with preset: { easy: X, medium: Y, hard: Z }
- API route will use 'else' path (sequential generation)
- Questions generated in sequence: Easy → Medium → Hard  
- Each subsequent generation gets context from previous ones
- No more duplicate questions across difficulty levels

🔍 **Log Pattern Change:**
- OLD: 3 separate log entries with individual difficulty calls
- NEW: 1 log entry showing '🔄 Using sequential generation with deduplication'

The fix ensures the sequential generation with deduplication that was implemented will actually be used instead of the separate API calls that were causing duplicate questions.
