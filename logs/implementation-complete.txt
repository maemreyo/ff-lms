✅ Sequential Generation with Deduplication Implementation Complete

🔄 **What was implemented:**
1. Updated QuestionGenerationOptions interface to include previousQuestions parameter
2. Enhanced singleDifficultyQuestionsPrompt to handle deduplication context
3. Created generateQuestionsSequentiallyWithDeduplication method in AIService
4. Updated API route to use sequential generation for mixed difficulty questions

🎯 **How it works:**
- When generating mixed difficulty questions (easy + medium + hard), the system now:
  1. Generates Easy questions first
  2. Passes Easy questions as context when generating Medium questions (avoids duplicates)
  3. Passes Easy + Medium questions as context when generating Hard questions (avoids duplicates)

📝 **Deduplication Strategy:**
- AI receives list of previously generated questions
- Prompt explicitly instructs to avoid similar topics, timeframes, and question patterns
- Focus on different transcript segments and question types
- Generate complementary rather than duplicate questions

🚀 **Benefits:**
- Eliminates duplicate questions across difficulty levels
- Maintains quality by using separate API calls for each difficulty
- Provides AI with context to create diverse, complementary questions
- Preserves existing single-difficulty generation (no breaking changes)

The implementation is complete and all TypeScript errors are resolved!
